# ☁️ Project 1: Static Website on AWS S3

## 🧭 Overview
This project demonstrates how to host a simple static website on Amazon S3 using public access and static website hosting.  
It’s my first hands-on AWS project as part of my cloud journey.

## 🛠️ Steps
1. Created S3 bucket (`abuhurayra-s3-site`)
2. Disabled "Block all public access"
3. Uploaded `index.html` and `error.html`
4. Added a public bucket policy for read-only access
5. Enabled static website hosting
6. Verified the site via the S3 public endpoint
